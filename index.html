      <p><img src="Yu-Cheng.JPG" class="selfie" alt="My photo"/> &nbsp; &nbsp; My name is <b>Yu-Cheng Deng</b> <b>鄧宇成</b>. I am very enthusiastic about system test, software QA and automation framework development, and I am now working at <b>Rivian<b/> as a <b>System Test Engineer</b>. For my job responsibilities, I mainly work on testing automation, utility tool development for testing, and conduct system level testing on electric vehicle. <br/>
         &nbsp; &nbsp; I am also a recent graduate from the <b> <i>University of California, Davis</i></b> with <b> <i>M.S.</I> </b>  degree in <b> <i>Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)</i> </b>. I was a graduate researcher in <b> <a href="https://marculab.bme.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank"> Marcu Lab</a> </b> of Biomedical Engineering Department at the University of California, Davis, and my research was regarding fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIm) data visualization in both off-line and real-time application, designing user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) for FLIm map construction.
         &nbsp; &nbsp; Also, I was a vocational high school student who started his career in Electrical Engineering since 16, and then I received my B.S. degree also in <i>Electrical Engineering</i> from <i>National Taipei Univeristy of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan</i>. Throughout the life as an undergraduate student, I actively joined lots of school activities and was a CEO in EE student association.
